## Getting Started :checkered_flag:

These instructions will get you a copy of the role for your Ansible playbook. Once launched, it will install [Clickhouse](https://clickhouse.com/) in a Debian system.

### Prerequisites :ballot_box_with_check:

Ansible 4.x.x version installed.

Molecule 3.x.x version installed.

For testing purposes, [Molecule](https://molecule.readthedocs.io/) with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) as driver and [Goss](https://github.com/aelsabbahy/goss) as verifier.

### Installing :inbox_tray:

Create or add to your roles dependency file (e.g requirements.yml):

```yml
- src: idealista.clickhouse_role
  scm: git
  version: 3.0.1
  name: clickhouse_role
```

Install the role with ansible-galaxy command:

```sh
ansible-galaxy install -p roles -r requirements.yml -f
```

Use in a playbook:

```yml
---
- hosts: someserver
  roles:
    - role: clickhouse_role
```

## Usage :runner:

Look to the [defaults](defaults/main.yml) properties file to see the possible configuration properties, it is very likely that you will not need to override any variables but don't forget to set your Admin user ü¶∏

- [`main.yml`](./defaults/main.yml) for superset general purpose vars.

### üëâ Don't forget

- ü¶∏ To set your Admin user and use a secure üîë password.
- üìù To set the `clickhouse_custom_config_file_path` and / or `clickhouse_custom_users_file_path` if you are going to use custom config files.
  - üëâ See the [ClickHouse doc](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/operations/configuration-files/).
- ‚òëÔ∏è To enable or disable using `clickhouse_role_manage_X` vars what things the role should manage.
- üìù To set users, quotas, profiles, databases to create.
  - ‚ÑπÔ∏è Or to unset if you want to DROP things.
  - üëâ See the default molecule scenario [`group_vars`](./molecule/default/group_vars/clickhouse_group.yml) for more

### ‚ùó You must know

- ‚ö†Ô∏è Note that are two ways to set users for ClickHouse, `users.xml` or via SQL-query, to distinguish both methods note that in this role we use `clickhouse_custom_users_xml` and `clickhouse_custom_users` respectively (SQL recommended).
- ‚ùó To make us of the 'EXCEPT' clauses for [quota assignation](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/statements/create/quota/) or [user grantees](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/statements/create/user/#grantees) for example, you can add a minus or dash _( - )_ before the name.
- ‚ùó When setting `password_type` for users, it should be one of [this](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/statements/create/user/#identification)
- ‚ùó When setting `keyed` for quota, it should be one of [this](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/statements/create/quota/)
- ‚ùó In case you're using LDAP or Kerberos, set each with their own property `ldap_server` or 'kerberos' so `password_type` is not required

##### Custom user definition example:

  ```yml
  clickhouse_custom_users:
    - user:
      name: "Takumi"
      password_type: plaintext_password
      password: "AE86"
      networks:
        - "IP '::/0'"
      settings:
        - "max_memory_usage = 10000000000"
      role:
        - projectd_members
        - tofu_shop
      profile:
        - default
      grantees:
        - projectd_members
      quota: "default"
      databases: [ProjectD]
      # ldap_server: project.d
      # kerberos: ""
