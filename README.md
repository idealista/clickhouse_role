This ansible role installs [Clickhouse](https://clickhouse.com/) in a Debian environment. It has been tested for Debian bullseye.

This role has been generated using the [cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter) tool, you can generate a similar role that fits your needs using the this [cookiecutter template](https://github.com/idealista/cookiecutter-ansible-role).

## Getting Started :checkered_flag:

These instructions will get you a copy of the role for your Ansible playbook. Once launched, it will install [Clickhouse](https://clickhouse.com/) in a Debian system.

### Prerequisites :ballot_box_with_check:

Ansible 5.x.x version installed.

Molecule 3.x.x version installed.

For testing purposes, [Molecule](https://molecule.readthedocs.io/) with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) as driver and [Goss](https://github.com/aelsabbahy/goss) as verifier.

### Installing :inbox_tray:

Create or add to your roles dependency file (e.g requirements.yml):

```yml
- src: idealista.clickhouse_role
  scm: git
  version: 3.2.0
  name: clickhouse_role
```

Install the role with ansible-galaxy command:

```sh
ansible-galaxy install -p roles -r requirements.yml -f
```

Use in a playbook:

```yml
---
- hosts: someserver
  roles:
    - role: clickhouse_role
```

## Usage :runner:

Look to the [defaults](defaults/main.yml) properties file to see the possible configuration properties, it is very likely that you will not need to override any variables but don't forget to set your Admin user ü¶∏

- [`main.yml`](./defaults/main.yml) for superset general purpose vars.

### üëâ Don't forget

- ü¶∏ To set your Admin user and use a secure üîë password.
- üìù To set the `clickhouse_custom_config_file_path` and / or `clickhouse_custom_users_file_path` if you are going to use custom config files.
  - üëâ See the [ClickHouse doc](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/operations/configuration-files/).
- ‚òëÔ∏è To enable or disable using `clickhouse_role_manage_X` vars what things the role should manage.
- üìù To set users, quotas, profiles, grants, databases to create.
  - ‚ÑπÔ∏è Or to unset if you want to DROP things.
  - üëâ See the default molecule scenario [`group_vars`](./molecule/default/group_vars/clickhouse_group.yml) for more

### ‚ùó You must know

- ‚ùó To make us of the 'EXCEPT' clauses for [quota assignation](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/statements/create/quota/) or [user grantees](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/statements/create/user/#grantees) for example, you can add a minus or dash _( - )_ before the name.
- ‚ùó When setting `password_type` for users, it should be one of [this](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/statements/create/user/#identification)
- ‚ùó When setting `keyed` for quota, it should be one of [this](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/statements/create/quota/)
- ‚ùó In case you're using LDAP or Kerberos, set each with their own property `ldap_server` or 'kerberos' so `password_type` is not required
- ‚ö†Ô∏è `clickhouse_replicated_tables_macros` is deprecated, please use `clickhouse_macros` var

#### Users and roles

- ‚ö†Ô∏è Note that are two ways to set users for ClickHouse, `users.xml` or via SQL-query, to distinguish both methods note that in this role we use `clickhouse_custom_users_xml` and `clickhouse_custom_users` respectively (SQL recommended).
- ‚ö†Ô∏è When granting, you must know:
  - When performing the GRANT actions to maintain the perms & privs clean a "general" REVOKE is performed before GRANTing
  - There is an option to disable that before "GRANTS" clean up: `clickhouse_custom_grants_previous_cleanup`
  - When granting permissions and privileges the order of the items in definition list takes precedence, is recommended to do this grant from less to the most restrictive.
    - üëâ See example below, more at the default molecule scenario [`group_vars`](./molecule/default/group_vars/clickhouse_group.yml) for more.
  - Statements Aliases are valid, but not handled at "ansible level" so this results in task making comparisions like `privileges: [DELETE]` vs `system.grants access_type = ALTER DELETE` (from ClickHouse), so we recommend set "un-aliased" perms and privs.
  - When performing REVOKE or GRANT if a problem occurs may be result in unexpected / removed perms & privs in the ClickHouse DB ¬°¬°Be extra careful!!
  - You can GRANT a role to a role, or roles to users with `clickhouse_custom_grant_roles`.

##### Custom user definition example:

  ```yml
  clickhouse_custom_users:
    - user:
      name: "Takumi"
      password_type: plaintext_password
      password: "AE86"
      networks:
        - "IP '::/0'"
      settings:
        - "max_memory_usage = 10000000000"
      role:
        - projectd_members
        - tofu_shop
      profile:
        - default
      grantees:
        - projectd_members
      quota: "default"
      databases: [ProjectD]
      # ldap_server: project.d
      # kerberos: ""

  clickhouse_custom_grants:
  - on:
    databases: [Akina]
    tables: ["*"]
    privileges: [SELECT]
    to: [initial_d]
  - on:
    # cluster:
    databases: ["Akina"]
    tables: [calendar, records]
    # columns: [Notes]
    privileges: [ALL]
    to: [Takumi, Iketani]
    with_grant_option: True
  - on:
    # cluster:
    databases: ["Akina"]
    tables: [records]
    privileges: [SELECT, UPDATE]
    to: [Iketani]
    with_grant_option: False

  clickhouse_custom_grant_roles:
    - roles: [initial_d]
      to: [Takumi, Iketani]
      # cluster:
```
